# Hospital-Management-System
AI mini project
Here's a hospital management mini project using AI. This project focuses on patient management and appointment scheduling. 

In the above hospital management mini project, artificial intelligence (AI) is not explicitly used. However, AI techniques can be applied to enhance various aspects of a hospital management system.

Appointment Scheduling Optimization: AI algorithms can be used to optimize the appointment scheduling process based on various factors such as patient preferences, doctor availability, and expected appointment duration. This can help minimize waiting times, improve resource utilization, and enhance overall efficiency.

This application demonstrates a simple web form where users can schedule appointments by providing their name, age, gender, date, and time. After submitting the form, a success message is displayed with the appointment details.
